# Hermes4Orbiter
An add-on for the Orbiter spaceflight simulator 2016 to reproduce the Hermes spaceplane.

For the first phase, the simulation model shall be based on the 8R1 "1.0" configuration, of which most illustrations and scale models are based 
on. Later, the more advanced A configuration will be used.

Once the open source version of [Orbiter](https://github.com/orbitersim/orbiter) has its first stable release, this one will be used as base requirement.

# Requirements

Mandatory requirements are:
* Orbiter 2016
* Spacecraft4 pack
* [VesselBuilder](https://github.com/fredenigma/VesselBuilder1) preview

optional:
* DirectX 9 client 

# Setting up workspace

1. Clone repository
2. Install Orbiter 2016
3. Install Spacecraft4 and VesselBuilder
4. Optional: Install DirectX 9 client

# Planned Milestones

- [ ] "0.1" VesselBuilder version is replaced by dedicated module of the same or better functionality
- [ ] "0.2" Use comparable Dynasoar aerodynamic data as stand-in for the reentry aerodynamics until more accurate data from ESA is available
- [ ] "0.3" Compatibility with Kourou-CSG add-on and launch scenarios
- [ ] "0.5" A MTFF campaign is available as scenarios for players
- [ ] "1.0" The full 1.0 version of Hermes of the year 1991 implemented with a 2D panel or a VC. Ejection seats operational, EVAs around the MTFF possible.
- [ ] "2.0" Include the improvements of the penultimate A configuration before the Hermes project was cancelled. Virtual Cockpit is now standard.
