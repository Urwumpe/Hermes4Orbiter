# Hermes4Orbiter
An add-on for the Orbiter spaceflight simulator 2016 to reproduce the Hermes spaceplane.

For the first phase, the simulation model shall be based on the 8R1 "1.0" configuration, of which most illustrations and scale models are based 
on. Later, the more advanced A configuration will be used.

Once the Opensource version of Orbiter has its first stable release, this one will be used as base requirement.
